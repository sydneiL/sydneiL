Hello! Iâ€™m sydneiL and I'm interested in designing and creating a healthcare mobile application in irtual reality known as VirtuaSurg so this application can assist medical and surgical staff worldwide and nationwide with performing quality surgeries and mental healthcare to patients. I'm currently in college for my Bachelor's in virtual reality because technology has always interested me since childhood. You can contact me via GitHub here at https://github.com/sydneiL so we can collaborate on this project and help save the world.
